The XOR Project, or Project Xavier (on Rails), strives to present a light-weight, cross-platform facade for OpenGL, using SDL. It does this by providing high-level constructs and convenient constructors. The end goal of Project Xavier is a framework that will allow creation of visualizations through XML generated by a simple GUI.

Project Xavier also includes support for doing trivial cluster graphics (video wall setup). This implementation is not seen as in competition with Chromium, as our goal is ease of use, not completeness.
